# Devlogs
Hey, there are your devlogs. If you curious what are we doing now you can read it below! 😊

Hard working on adding new languages for game and store. We switched to new engine version and created new custom template. We're trying our best to reduce size of the game, because is too too too large right now.

And also we started our devlog! Nice to see you all here! We're planning to push update
