# Devlogs
Hey, there are your devlogs. If you curious what are we doing now you can read it below! ðŸ˜Š

### 27.06.2023
- Update wasn't pushed out without some frictions. Version 21 is live now on the store with some changes like 10+ new languages and loading screen to take some work from main thread. Now, then all nessecary things are done we can focus on more fun aspects, like Services, new game modes and social stuff!

### 25.06.2023
- You guys are going crazy! We're 4 days from release and about to beat 100 downloads! We're very proud!
- Today new translations are going live (we hope so). We also translated Store Front to new languages so our players will be able to easier access Cake Defense!

### 24.06.2023
- We started our devlog! Nice to see you all here! We're planning to push update.
- Hard working on adding new languages for game and store. We switched to new engine version and created new custom template. We're trying our best to reduce size of the game, because is too too too large right now. At this moment the game is approx. 50 MB, we're aiming to reduce it by 36 MB to 14 MB. That would be perfect.
- We remember that done is better than perfect, but still we want to aim high. ðŸ˜Š
- It's crazy how things are going! We don't want to release new features without knowing that players are here and want to play.

### 21.06.2023
- Our first game **Cake Defense: Ants Invasion** is out now! We pushed release to Google Play for players! The game is still in development, but the base is done.

We also started to spread the word about our game. You now can follow us on:
